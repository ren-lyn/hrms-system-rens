# Human Resource Management System (HRMS)
## Cabuyao Concrete Development Corporation

### Project Overview
A comprehensive HRMS designed to streamline HR processes, reduce administrative workload, and improve employee satisfaction through automation of key HR functions.

### System Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive Human Resource Management System (HRMS) for Cabuyao Concrete Development Corporation. This system aims to streamline HR processes, reduce administrative workload, enhance operational efficiency, and improve employee satisfaction by automating essential HR functions. The system will provide a centralized platform for secure employee data management, automated payroll processing, real-time attendance tracking, leave management, recruitment and onboarding, and predictive turnover analytics to support data-driven HR decisions.

#### Specific Objectives:

1. **Centralized HR Management System**: Develop a centralized HR management system that securely stores, organizes, and manages employee records with comprehensive data integrity and access controls.

2. **Automated Payroll Processing**: Implement an automated payroll processing system to minimize errors, reduce delays, and ensure accurate salary computations with support for multiple pay components and tax calculations.

3. **Real-time Attendance Tracking**: Establish a real-time attendance tracking system that allows for efficient monitoring of employee working hours, overtime calculations, and attendance pattern analysis.

4. **Employee Self-Service Portal**: Create an online employee self-service portal where employees can easily access their attendance records, request leave, update personal information, view payslips, and access company policies.

5. **Leave Management Module**: Implement a comprehensive leave management module that simplifies the process of filing, approving, and tracking employee leave requests while enforcing company policies and maintaining accurate leave balances.

6. **Automated Reporting System**: Generate automated reports for payroll summaries, attendance monitoring, leave records, and performance metrics to assist HR professionals in data-driven decision-making.

7. **Performance Evaluation Module**: Integrate a performance evaluation module that allows HR personnel to assess employee contributions, conduct 360-degree feedback, track goals, and generate comprehensive performance reports.

8. **Recruitment and Onboarding System**: Develop a recruitment and onboarding module including job posting mechanics, application tracking system (ATS), candidate assessment tools, interview scheduling, and comprehensive onboarding checklists to streamline the hiring process.

9. **Predictive Turnover Analytics**: Implement predictive turnover analytics that uses attendance, performance, and behavioral data to flag employees who are likely to resign, enabling proactive HR interventions and retention strategies.

10. **End-User System Evaluation**: Evaluate the proposed HR management system through comprehensive end-user feedback from HR staff and administrative personnel based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 criteria:
    - 10.1 Functional suitability
    - 10.2 Performance efficiency  
    - 10.3 Interaction capability
    - 10.4 Reliability
    - 10.5 Security

11. **Expert Technical Evaluation**: Assess the proposed HR management system through expert feedback from web developers and technical specialists based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 criteria:
    - 11.1 Functional suitability
    - 11.2 Performance efficiency
    - 11.3 Security
    - 11.4 Maintainability

By integrating these key features, the system will ensure compliance with labor laws and company policies while promoting transparency and reducing manual errors in HR operations.
